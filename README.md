### Hi there 👋
I'm a researcher who specialises in electrochemistry and spent some time working in a data science team:
- 🛠️ My main programming language is python which I use with SQL for data science and applications
- 🤖 I am improving my C and C++ for micro-controller applications, as well as python for machine learning
- 🌱 I am starting to play with golang and Julia
- 🔋 I am hope to use electrochemistry, data science and programming for sustianabile chemistry projects ♻️

- Fun Facts: My first phone was a Sagem MY3020 ☎️, and chemistry is really all about electrons 🧪
