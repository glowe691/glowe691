### Hi there 👋
I'm a researcher who specialises in electrochemistry. I've also spent some time working in a data science team and with a venture studio:
- 🛠️ My main programming language is python which I used with SQL for data science and applications
- 😄 I am a bit of a unit testing geek
- 🌱 I have used C++ & arduino for making some custom pumps but as you can see from my code, it needs work 🤖

- Fun Facts: My first phone was a Sagem MY3020 ☎️, my github profile image is the first thing I ever drew in blender, and chemistry is really all about electrons 🧪
